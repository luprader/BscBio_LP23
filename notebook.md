### up to 04/08/2023
This entry compiles everything up to the first entry.  
The Gbif data for *Harmonia axyridis* was downloaded from the website, Copernicus land cover classification layers for 1992-2020 as well. 
The CHELSA bioclim layers were downloaded with wget.  
At first, all Gbif occurrences were checked for NA values in coordinates, year and coordinate uncertainty. 
Afterwards, they were cleaned using all default tests for the function `clean_coordinates` from `CoordinateCleaner`.  
The land cover layers were aggregated to match the resolution of the climate data, so a 3x3 cell area of the original layer was aggregated to one larger cell, matching the resolution of the CHELSA bioclim layers.
The new value was the mode of the 9 grid cells.  
The global layer was cropped to two spatial extents. 
The europe extent was arbitrarily chosen: 
(xmin = -25, ymin = 35, xmax = 65, ymax = 72). 
The native extent was chosen from (Orlova-Bienkowskaja, Ukrainsky & Brown, 2015), using Fig. 1 and the mentioned locations to draw an outline around the native range:
(xmin = 70, ymin = 20, xmax = 150, ymax = 65).  
The CHELSA bioclim layers were merged, cropped and resampled to match the two new extents of the land cover layers.  
A rough introduction and methods draft was written, as well as this entry.


### 04/08/2023
The occurrence cleaning code was rewritten to first subset the occurrences into the two spatial extents before conducting tests, since for example outlier tests would be heavily influenced by the global distribution. The tests used now are :
('capitals', 'centroids', 'duplicates', 'equal', 'institutions', 'outliers', 'seas', 'zeros'), with the default settings for each test.
Using the 'urban' test resulted in very large amounts of flags, which makes sense given that the distribution of *Harmonia axyridis* is in part due to human distribution as a control agent.
To keep some of that information and still correct for some bias, 'urban' was not used as a test, but the 'capitals' test with a rather large radius of 10 km.
The subsetting before cleaning targets NAs in coordinates, year, uncertainty and also removes all points after 2022, before 1991 in Europe (first invasive occurrence) and with an uncertainty larger than 1 km.

### 05/08/2023
Some analysis was conducted to visualize the amount of occurrences per year for each spatial extent. 
It was noticed, that the amount of European occurrences prior to 2000 was greatly underestimated. 
The timeframe will probably only be 2002-2022 instead of 1992-2022 because of that, but a more detailed analysis will be done tomorrow.

### 06/08/2023
The amounts of occurrences per year were computed in more detail.
This resulted in two plots (R/plots/clean_occ_yearly_*.png) and the following values:
"Raw EU < 2002: 32 Raw Native < 2002: 35"  
"Cleaned EU < 2002: 0 Cleaned Native < 2002: 5"  
Because of this, even though the first occurrence according to EASIN was 1991 in Belgium, the temporal extent will not include years prior to 2002 anymore.
There might be value in creating an initial model with the 2 and 12 cleaned points prior to 2002, so for now they are not excluded in the cleaning process.
Only the land cover layers that were not needed anymore were removed from the used data folder.
The thought has come to mind, that it might be worthwhile to not use a general duplicate test, but instead only check for duplicates in one year.
Having the exact same coordinates in several years would indicate lazy sampling though and might not be desirable because of that.

The outline intro was refined more and the methods adapted to include the new temporal extent.

The generation of pseudo-absence/background points was started, generating 5 points in a 10 km radius around a presence point and checking for water or a distance closer than 0.5km to any other presence point. 
The presence points will be subset per year and area to be able to give them the corresponding labels.

### 08/08/2023
The generation of background points was finished.
Subsetting was not necessary, since the generated points were automatically assigned by the `buffer` and `spatSample` functions from `terra`.
The script currently takes a lot of time due to the minimum distance check as it is implemented right now.
There might be better options of doing this, for example with intersected buffer polygons instead of a normal distance calculation.

### 09/08/2023
The generation of absence/background points was improved to have an estimated runtime of 3h.
(the past script was never executed to completion, took way too long)
The point distance approach was removed and replaced with removing distance buffer circles from the range circles and generating points in these new polygons.
The distance circles are also merged into one polygon to prevent unnecessary iterations when erasing.
The current amount of absences per presence is 5, with a range of 10 km and a minimum distance of 1 km to other presences.

### 10/08/2023
Merging all minimum distance circles (1Â km), failed since the combined polygon was too large to compute. 
Combining seems to not improve the runtime at all after further investigation.
The new approach now is to geographically subset all points and compute the absences for each subset.
The total extent is now split into extents until the desired density per extent is reached. (function `lp_subdiv_pts`)
Afterwards, all occurrences are cropped to those extents and then separately used for absence generation. (function `lp_gen_abs`)
The functions for these steps are defined in a separate function.r script.


### 11/08/2023
A benchmark of the absence generation regarding different desired point densities (end_ptcount) then computing sub extents was attempted.
After creating a dummy land cover layer with some NA space to include absence flagging, different subset amounts relative to the tested total point count were tested: none, 1/2, 1/10 and 1/100. 
This means that for 1000 presence points, a subset to 100, 10 and 500 was tested for computation speed.
This process was repeated for 5000 and 10000 dummy presences, resulting in the plot 'abs_gen_subdiv_bench.png'.
From this, the decision was made to run absence generation with a desired density of <10000 presences, meaning a division of ~1/12.6 for ~126000 total presences.

### 12/08/2023
An error in the absence replacement generation was fixed and absence generation was run for the first time for all presences.
The runtime was 43 minutes.

I want to take the time here to explain the subsetting in more detail, also touching on drawbacks:
Starting from the merged extent of Europe and Asia, the extent is split along its longer side.
The resulting two extents are added to a list of extents to check.
When the loop selects an extent, it calculates the amount of points inside it.
If the amount is larger than the specified cutoff (end_ptcount), the extent is split again.
Otherwise, if the count is smaller or equal, the extent is moved to a list of "good" extents.
A count of 0 results in the extent being removed from all lists.

This approach is pretty fast and computation efficient, but it comes with a drawback.
When generating absences, the main goal is to not generate absences too close to presences.
A presence point could be very close to an extent border though.
This introduces the possibility of absences being generated on the other side of the border, which should normally have been excluded for being too close.  
One could improve the subsetting process to take a minimum distance to the border into account, but this would probably result in way longer computation times, possibly not improving the total time anymore.
At this point in time, this drawback is accepted as part of the absence generation, not only because the current amount of extents (29), does not introduce too many borders.  
One has to also acknowledge that the chance for this error will be severely higher in regions with more point density, which have to also be split more often to reach the max point count.
In those areas, the error will not have a severe impact though, since the presence density is already so high.

### 13/08/2023
A first version of bioclim and land cover value extraction for the pa data was finished.
It will be rewritten with a defined function and progress statements tomorrow.
There might be benefit in running the absence generation with no subsets, since the estimated runtime would only bee double the time with subsets according to the benchmark results (so <2h).
This would remove any possible errors, but there might be issues with memory similar to a merged polygon from 10/08/2023. 
A test run will be done overnight.

### 14/08/2023
The test run without sub extents failed with an out of memory error.
Maybe there are options to fix the memory error, with detriment to runtime, but this will not be pursued for now.  
The value extraction for all years was rewritten with a defined function `lp_ext_vals`.

The maximum distance for absences was adjusted to 18 km, the estimated "typical" flight distance for *Harmonia axyridis* according to (Jeffries et al. 2013).
There are many papers discussing minimum and maximum sampling distance of absences.
The conclusions are often rather specific, so it is hard to know what the best values would be right now.
With this, the current choices are rather arbitrary, with 1 km minimum being the maximum presence location uncertainty, and typical flight distance as a maximum just to have some limit on the potential area of interest for a specific presence point.

After checking the pa data, an error with the absence generation was found.
Generated absences were never checked against water or NA.
The code was fixed and new benchmarks were run.

### 15/08/2023
The benchmark results show a different optimum of subdivision now, but not a huge increase in runtime as feared at first.
Memory limitations seem to occur with subdivisions above 10000, this will be investigated. (maybe WSL issue)
For now, some minor memory management was added to the absence generation process.

### 16/08/2023
It was found that generated absences and some presences were still in water according to their lccs_class.
This was in part due to not testing for land cover in the cleaning process.
The occurrence cleaning process was then extended to test for water or NA in the corresponding Copernicus land cover layers.
The absence generation had to be modified to use the correct land cover layer for each year, while still testing for proximity to presences from all years.
Subdivision is now only used for Europe, since Asia has so little points in comparison.
A new benchmark was conducted, with a similar optimum to yesterday (1/2).
A full computation of absences will be conducted overnight.

## 17/08/2023
Absence generation was successful, with a computation time of ~92 mins for a Europe subdivision to <20000.
The absence generation is now only conducted for years 2002-2020.
Those few points prior to 2002 are negligible, and 21/22 will only be used for model validation.
With this, a new plot of the used subdivisions was created and the procedure of variable selection was started.

There is the question of what data to use for variable selection, since variable correlation can be different for different years for example.
This was also visualized comparing correlation matrices for all bioclim variables of 2002, 2011 and 2020.  
Since the iteration should help with future models of emerging invasive species, an approach using the earliest usable year seems reasonable.
This way, the iteration can model an example of really trying to model *H. axyridis* at the time of its emergence.

Right now, bioclim variable selection uses variance inflation factors of a GLM fitted on data only from 2002 to choose the best variables for modeling. Variables, also using the squared values of each variable as an option, are dropped iteratively until no VIF in the model exceeds a value of 10.
Squared variables are also dropped before their linear counterparts.
The order of dropping seems to have a large influence on the outcome though.
For comparison, this iteration was also conducted with only 2020 occurrences used.
The resulting variables for both years are commented out in "1.3-model_var-select.r" right now.

The yearly occurrence plots were also updated with the new cleaned occurrence data.

### 18/08/2023
For variable selection a PCA for the land cover classes was conducted by creating binary columns for each present class.
The PCA results in many dimensions with small explained variances (<15%).
A PCA of the scaled bioclim variables is very successful in comparison, so maybe the method is implemented wrong.
Plots were created to visualize the PCA results for land cover.

### 21/08/2023
Niche comparison was implemented using the `ecospat` library.
It follows methods described in (Broennimann et al. 2011).
Right now, two iterations of niche comparisons are computed.
The first one compares the climatic niche of each year to all data of the native range.
The second iteration compares each year of data in Europe to the year after in order to have a measure for the niche change.
The comparison of each year with the native range might not be that beneficial in the end, since the main interest there would be the difference between the native and invaded range.

Absence generation was extended to also include 2021 and 2022, since the absences are used as background during niche comparison.

### 22/08/2023
Model variable selection was extended to now incorporate the land cover PCA results into the VIF selection process.
Land cover PCA was fixed by correcting `scale.unit` to FALSE, since a 0/1 binary variable is obviously not scaled to zero mean and unit variance.
This results in a great PCA with almost 40% of variance covered by PC1.
The VIFs of each PCA component are very low, even at the beginning of dropping variables.
With each run until now, no land cover dimension has been dropped by the VIF algorithm.

It was also discovered, that a large portion of occurrences are in areas with the lccs_class 'urban'.
This could have bad influences on the modelling capability, yet it could also be a distinct feature of *H. axyridis*.
The modelling will show if those points skew the predictions too much.

A new file named openissues.md was created to collect all concerns and unresolved issues regarding the project.
It was also verified, that the buffer generation creates equal area circles.

### 23/08/2023
The land cover PCA used in variable selection was improved to use a cutoff value of 80% for the cumulative variance covered by PCA axes.
To prepare for model building and prediction, the selected variables were added as value columns to the pa data, reprojecting land cover to the used PCA dimensions (`lp_pca_proj`).

To enable prediction in geographic space, rasters were created with layers corresponding to the projected lccs classes (`lp_pca_proj_lc`).
It uses a parallel for loop for the years of land cover data, since the projection is very CPU intensive.

## 24/08/2023
After it was attempted to run 1.1-gen_absences overnight, an error with the generation in Europe was fixed (21/22 not using sub extent).
The iteration over each sub extent in Europe was also parallelized with `foreach` to improve computation time.

With this finished, model building was started.

### 25/08/2023
A full absence generation was run, having a runtime of ~130 min.
The outline was improved, updating and expanding the methods to the current state of progress.

### 29/08/2023
It was noticed that a glm fit on the native data did not produce a working model at all.
Investigating the value histograms it was noticed that absence generation created absences mimicking the distribution of the presence points.
For now, absence generation was simplified to just take random spatial samples in the specified extent for each year.

### 30/08/2023
For all generated raster files, a format switch from .grd to .tif was made, since they take up less space and are used by `terra` for internal processes anyway.

### 31/08/2023
The function `lp_pca_proj_lc` was modified to remove oceans beforehand, which speeds up computation.
The generation of prediction rasters was removed for now, since model accuracy can be computed just from the extracted pa data as well.
With this, the creation of a modelling-ready dataframe was moved from `1.4-model_data_prep.r` to `1.3-model_var_select.r`.
With randomly sampled absences it was noticed that the bio14 layer for 2011-2040 has NA cells at one edge, which is why the geographic extent for Europe was slightly modified.

A first version of the basic model building structure was made, implementing a native fit with `glm` and `gam`.

### 01/09/2023
Model evaluation was implemented, as well as fits with `gbm` and `maxnet`.
Right now, a complete creation of a native model and evaluation with 2022 data is realized in `2.2-model_building.r`.
With this, the basic pipeline for this project is more or less in place.

### 03/09/2023
Model evaluation was changed to return a list of accuracy measurements (PCC, sensitivity, specificity and Cohens Kappa).
A test run with 2004 and 2008 as cutoff years showed that the current maxent implementation has a very long computation time, the used formula might need to be simplified.

### 04/09/2023
Model evaluation was extended to include an ensemble prediction using the TSS weighted means of all model predictions.
Due to a suggestion, land cover PCA was changed to be computed on relative area covered by each lccs class in a buffer around each point.
Currently, the buffer is set to a radius of 18 km, the typical flight distance of *H. axyridis*. 
The value extraction will have to be rewritten using parallel for loops in order to decrease computation time.

### 05/09/2023
Value extraction was rewritten to use a parallelized for loop over all years.
A full execution will be done overnight, since the computation time seems to still be rather long.

### 06/09/2023
A full value extraction with the land cover buffers apparently took 12 hours to complete, even with parallelization.
Main bottleneck is probably RAM.
Variable selection was run with the new land cover data, resulting in the first two components already covering more than 90% of cumulative variance.
Due to this, the cutoff was increased to 90% to at least include the first two components.
There might be reason in only including the first component, since it already accounts for 84% of cumulative variance.
Model building now uses a parallel for loop over the years of the iteration.
A simplified maxnet formula, using linear, hinge and threshold feature classes is now used.
This does not seem to influence computation time significantly though.
A full run of the iteration will be done overnight.

### 07/09/2023
A full run of model building did not finish overnight due to an error, which was fixed.
The current state outline was ported to the main thesis document, next steps will be to rewrite methods and introduction.

### 10/09/2023
A section giving information about *Harmonia axyridis* was written in the main thesis.
There will be additional chapters on invasion theory and SDMs in order to give sufficient background.

### 11/09/2023
All parallel code was edited to potentially allow all cores.
This was mainly done since apparently even thread numbers are optimized better by the operating system.
A background section in invasion theory was written.

### 12/09/2023
Model building was edited to save the results for each year separately as well, making it easier to compute the results in batches (if necessary).
A background section on SDMs was written.

### 13/09/2023
A background section for the used modelling methods was written.
After a better understanding of maxnet's feature classes, threshold features were removed and quadratic features were added back.

### 14/09/2023
A rewrite of the methods chapter was started.
Citation style was changed to the Nature superscript citation style for better readability.

### 15/09/2023
Model performance was plotted, computing the two tss for every model and year, following year and 2022.
Model performance is incredibly bad for all models, not getting over 0.2 for any year.
TSS is even decreasing on average for all models after 2011.
This indicates that either the model building or data processing is flawed, since its hardly believable that the species is impossible to predict.
Plotting the presence and absence datapoints for europe showed that the density subdivision seems to significantly bias background, even with random selection in those areas.
Absence generation will have to be revisited, as well as the exact process of ensemble calculation.

### 03/10/2023
Absence generation was changed to not use any density correction currently.
After test model building, variable selection was changed to use data from 2022 only, since it seemed like the variables did not produce meaningful models.
The methods chapter was updated to the current status.

### 06/10/2023
Niche comparison was edited to save the niche overlap, equality and similarity results for further analysis.
Equality and similarity tests were shifted to be optional.
A pearson correlation test was implemented, trying to see if model accuracy is more dependent on data amount or state of invasion (niche overlap).

### 12/10/2023
After a meeting, some suggestions were implemented to try and find the underlying issues with the models.
Variable selection now uses a gam instead of a glm to select variables, no quadratic versions are included anymore.
A plot to visualize performance of the native model was implemented, it actually performs quite well, especially in predicting later years.
Model building now uses fewer points, randomly sampled for each year to only use 1/2. (save time while testing)
Using even less seemed to impact the results too much to be comparable to using all data.

### 15/10/2023
A test file was created to improve model building by using the native data.
Current tests suggest that the issue lies in threshold selection, since different optimization methods all return similar model performance.

### 19/10/2023
The error was found to not be in threshold selection, but in predicting the evaluation dataset.
The data was not scaled correctly, leading to completely wrong values.
The correct model performance will be evaluated in the following days.

### 20/10/2023
some final tests were conducted to ensure a working model building.

### 21/10/2023
A test run with no subdivision was conducted, leading to very well performing models.
The next step will be to try and re-implement subdivision, since the models right now are surely very biased.

### 22/10/2023
A test with subdivision was run, showing huge losses in performance. 
A possible reason could be, that land cover PCA used in variable selection right now uses the presence/absence data to compute the PCA dimensions. 
With the data heavily biased, the PCA dimensions are very biased too.
Variable selection will be rewritten to use random points in Europe, since that would be equivalent to reducing the dimensionality of Europe in total.

### 05/11/2023
Variable selection was rewritten to use random points in Europe to compute land cover PCA.
A test run will be done overnight. If the result is not much better, it also seems sufficient to use a rougher subdivision, if the goal is to increase tss.
This implies a trade-off between tss and (hypothetically) more accurate models, which is hard to estimate, since it is hard to speculate the true niche distribution.

### 06/11/2023
Using separate points for PCA did not seem to improve model performance at all.
A new subdivision function was written, splitting the extent of presences into n x n sub extents.
Hopefully, this can create better absences and not decrease performance as much.

### 10/11/2023
Subdivision with a grid did not have a large difference to the previous density subdivision.
An issue with a weird "jump" in accuracy was found.
In model building, only the years of 2011 to 2020 were computed for the recent, so testing was done wrong.
New tests will be done, and maybe an implementation to somehow visualize the performance in geographical space without needing to compute new rasters.
The tests will be no subdivision, and depending on results iterations of the different subdivision approaches.

### 16/11/2023
Tests have been conducted to see the influence of absence density subdivision on model performance.
A plot was implemented to show the prediction for presences of a given year by the model of the previous year.
As expected, density subdivision lead to a decrease in overall performance.
Surprisingly, the performance loss was in the areas with low amounts of presences, so even further biasing the models.
This has in part to do with the fact, that almost no reference absences are generated in those areas, if all absences are generated relaticve to the density subdivision (plot ens_18pred19_subdiv_pts_50pc.png).
Because of this, the generation was modified to first generate a base background of random points, and then add a layer of density corrected absences as well.
This improved accuracy again, though still it seems like the spacial bias remains.
Some further tests will be done, trying different ratios of background to density correction.

### 19/12/2023
Further tests have been done, suggesting that the best absence generation is to generate a completely random base background accounting for one third of the total absences, and then use a subdivision cutoff of 0.3*total presence count for the density correction.
There could probably be more tests to really get the sensitivity (true positive rate) to max, since the tests have only been conducted on a visual basis.

For niche overlap, a test will be done, comparing the results using Schoener's D to using Warren's I, maybe giving a better result for overlap, since I is closer to the stability measure from `ecospat.niche.dyn.index`, showing the true overlap of current year presences with the prior year for example.

### 20/12/2023
Niche overlap was switched back to Schoener's D since it is consistent with the proposed `ecospat` workflow in the paper.
The three niche dynamic indices were also added for the yearly calculations, but are not used in analysis for now.
Niche comparison for each year in Europe was shifted to compare each year to the native niche, which gives a more stable base for interpretation of the overlap and especially the dynamic indices.
Also, code was implemented to create an animated gif from all year niche plots.

### 22/12/2023
A plot was made visualizing the niche dynamic index development for all three indices.
To be able to really compare correlation, regression analysis might also be a valid method.
An implementation might be tried in the following days.

### 27/12/23
A plot showing the results of the niche dynamic indices has been made, as well as some minor tweaks for other plots.

An attempt was made to use regression in order to measure the correlation between tss and the niche values, though it seems like this might need some additional thought.

### 04/01/24
The main thesis document was improved with a part of the pending supervisor suggestions, also adding most of the formatting requirements.
Niche comparison was switched back to compare between the years of invasion in Europe, since that way the niche change can be seen relative to the niche size, which can be impacted by the data amount.
Two figures were created in order to be used in the thesis later on, one showing the amount of cleaned presences for each year on a log scale, distinguishing Europe and Asia. And the other showing the difference between the raw and cleaned dataset.

### 07/02/24
Since the last entry, a bit of progress was made.
A figure explaining the subdivision algorithm in more detail was made as well as a detailed plot showing the niche dynamic indices.
Another plot was made, showing that the reason for decreasing tss over the years is definitely linked to increasing false positives, maybe caused in part due to the bias correction.
After a meeting, it was decided to use sensitivity as a measure for model performance instead.

### 14/02/24
More writing was done, improving the introduction and methods section, as well as starting the results section by showing the progression of data availability over time.
Over the next few days, a full run of the project code without thinning the data will be done, just to get the current total results as a guide for writing. The results should not change much anymore, since no future parameter changes are planned (currently).

### 19/02/24
A section reporting the results of niche analysis was started, additionally some supplementary figures and tables were added.

### 20/02/24
Writing the results of niche analysis was mostly finished and the part reporting SDM modelling was started.

### 21/02/24
A lot of tables and figures were added, especially to the appendix.
The results section now contains all results that are going to be shown.

### 22/02/24
First versions of discussion, conclusion, abstract and so on were finished, concluding the first draft of the complete thesis.

### 28/03/24
Supervisor feedback was incorporated, mainly improving the methods and discussion chapter, as well as adding a plot showing the predictions of each yearly model in the appendix.

### 31/03/24
Some small formulations and citations were changed/added.

### 24/05/24
The thesis was handed in after a final meeting.
